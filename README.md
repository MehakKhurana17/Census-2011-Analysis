# Highlights:

This project aimed to analyze the 2011 Census data of India to derive various demographic statistics. The following tasks were performed:

1. Total population, growth rate, average sex ratio, and average literacy rate of India were determined based on the 2011 Census data.

2. The top three states with the highest growth percentage were identified to take necessary steps for the growing population in those states.

3. The bottom three states with the lowest sex ratio and literacy rate were identified.

4. Statistical calculations were performed to determine the number of males and females, literates, and illiterates in various states.

5. The area per person for the current census population was compared to the area per person for the previous census population.

The results of this project can provide valuable insights into the demographic trends and distribution of resources in India, aiding policymakers and researchers in making informed decisions.
